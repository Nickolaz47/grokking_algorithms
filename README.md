# Grokking Algorithms in Go

This repository is my exploration of algorithms in the Go programming language, inspired by the book [*Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people*](https://encurtador.com.br/lFO4r). It serves as a personal project to deepen my understanding of core algorithmic concepts while building fluency in Go.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to separate executable examples and core implementations:

- `cmd/`: Contains the main application with example runs of each algorithm.
- `internal/`: Houses individual algorithm implementations, each with clear comments and documentation.

## Implemented Algorithms

The algorithms currently explored in this repository include:

- **Binary Search**: Efficient search in sorted arrays.
- **Selection Sort**: Sorting by iteratively finding the minimum.
- **Quick Sort**: A recursive, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
- **Breadth-First Search**: Exploring nodes layer-by-layer in graphs.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finding shortest paths in weighted graphs.
- **Recursion**: Examples, including factorial calculation.
- **Greedy Algorithm**: Demonstrates a greedy approach to finding a short route between cities.

Each file is designed to be a self-contained learning module, providing insights into both the algorithm's logic and the idiomatic use of Go.
